# MMEE
Files from the MMEE course 2016

There are three branches:
- qPCR
- Sequencing
- ProteinPart

Each branch contains the files from that part of the course:

qPCR:
- datasheet
- graph Tra relative
- graph EF1a
- graph Tra

Sequencing:
- 6 sequences
- alignment
- phylogenetic tree

ProteinPart contains graphs from our small presentation on the HL-HA assay:
- Freshness of pigeon plasma
- Saliva
- Score 1 vs Score 2
- Standards per group
